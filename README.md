# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market

 This dataset is sourced from the CoinMarketCap API and contains information about the cryptocurrency market on December 6, 2017.
 The objective is to explore the market information of cryptocurrencies traded on that day, including their market capitalization and volatility.


Research Findings:

(1) Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the virtual currency trading market.

(2) Price fluctuations in a single day can range from as high as 800% (Fedoracoin) to as low as -100% (Flappycoin). Some cryptocurrencies can experience an increase in value by as much as 35 times within a week.

(3) There are only four cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization exceeding 10 billion dollars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and iota. Compared to the stock market, 
    where there are over 700 publicly traded companies with market capitalizations exceeding 10 billion dollars, the cryptocurrency market remains relatively niche.

(4)The volatility of cryptocurrency prices is extremely high, leading to elevated investment risks. There's a chance for overnight riches, but there's also a possibility of overnight destitution.



 使用數據集來自coinmarketcap API，提供20171206當天的虛擬貨幣市場資訊，目標為探索該市場中交易貨幣的市值與波動。

 研究結果: 
 
 (1) 比特幣為虛擬貨幣交易市場中市值最大的商品。
 
 (2) 在一天當中漲幅最高可以來到800%(fedoracoin)，最低可以跌至-100%(flappycoin)，也有虛擬貨幣在一周內可以上漲35倍的幅度。
 
 (3) 市值超過10b 的僅有 bitcoin、ethereum、bitcoin-cash、iota 等四個貨幣，相較美股市場(約700多家上市股票市值超過10b)的市值，虛擬貨幣市場仍算小眾。
 
 (4) 虛擬貨幣的價格波動極大，投資風險高，有一夜致富的機會，也有一夜之間窮困潦倒的可能。
